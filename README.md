# ad-click-prediction-logistic-regression
This repository contains the Ad Click Prediction project, which uses logistic regression to predict whether an internet user will click on an advertisement. The dataset comprises various user attributes, such as daily internet usage, area income, age, and whether the user is male, among other factors.
# Ad Click Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project utilizes logistic regression to predict whether a specific internet user will click on an advertisement. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset containing user attributes and ad interaction outcomes.

## Dataset Features
- **Daily Time Spent on Site**: Time spent on the site by the user (minutes)
- **Age**: User's age (years)
- **Area Income**: Average income of the user's geographical area
- **Daily Internet Usage**: User's daily average internet usage (minutes)
- **Ad Topic Line**: Advertisement headline
- **City**: User's city
- **Male**: Gender indicator (1 for male, 0 for female)
- **Country**: User's country
- **Timestamp**: Ad interaction timestamp
- **Clicked on Ad**: Binary indicator of whether the user clicked the ad

## Goals
Develop a model to classify whether a user will click on an ad based on their demographic and internet usage attributes.

## Repository Structure
- **Data**: Contains the synthetic advertising dataset.
- **Notebook**: Step-by-step analysis and model development using logistic regression.
